-- Hi there. ðŸŒŠ
--
-- If you're here to remove or modify StepManiaVersionIsSupported because the
-- StepMania version you use isn't supported â€“ I get where you're coming from.
--
-- It can be frustrating when you just want to play a free game and there seems
-- to be arbitrary walls up preventing that.  I get that that is what this
-- probably feels like.
--
-- For now, Simply Love supports SM5.0.12 and beta releases of SM5.1 from
-- the main StepMania project, which can be found on GitHub at
-- https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/
--
-- Other forks, older builds, other projects, etc. are blocked here, regardless
-- of their compatibility with Simply Love.  I am only one human person, and I've
-- taken on too much responsibility here with moving the post-ITG community forward
-- in a responsible, open, and inclusive manner.
--
-- I've done very little with my life that I am proud of, but I am confident that
-- this Simply Love project has helped dance game enthusiasts from all over the world
-- enjoy a silly arrow game together, as a community.
--
-- Regardless of their location or language, regardless of their access to specific
-- hardware with limited availability, almost anyone can install and use and benefit
-- from Simply Love.  This is a good thing, and I am proud of this.
--
-- Supporting this is not easy. It's almost always easier to do a quick fix that works
-- for one circumstance â€“ one particular machine, one particular hardware device, one
-- one particular community.  Writing code and designing software that accommodates the
-- broadest community is hard, but it's critically important.  It's the responsibility
-- I've gradually assumed over the years I've worked on Simply Love.
--
-- So, if you're here to remove of modify StepManiaVersionIsSupported as a quick fix,
-- I'll ask you to consider giving back to the broader community instead.
--
-- What features does your fork have that mainline StepMania doesn't?  Can they be
-- brought into mainline StepMania?  Maybe you don't know, maybe you're not a developer,
-- but maybe you know someone who does or is.  Ask.  Get things moving.  Contribute.
-- Everyone will be better off because you helped.
--
-- I appreciate your understanding.  Maybe we can share a dance in the future. :)

--                                                                quietly-turning
--                                                                4 July 2020

-- use StepManiaVersionIsSupported() to check if Simply Love supports the version of SM5 in use

StepManiaVersionIsSupported = function()
	return true
end

-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
-- game types like "kickbox" and "lights" aren't supported in Simply Love, so we
-- use this function to hardcode a list of game modes that are supported, and use it
-- in ScreenInit overlay.lua to redirect players to ScreenSelectGame if necessary.
--
-- (Because so many people have accidentally gotten themselves into lights mode without
-- having any idea they'd done so, and have then messaged me saying the theme was broken.)

CurrentGameIsSupported = function()
	-- a hardcoded list of games that Simply Love supports
	local support = {
		dance  = true,
		pump   = true,
		techno = true,
		para   = true,
		kb7    = true
	}
	-- return true or nil
	return support[GAMESTATE:GetCurrentGame():GetName()]
end

-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
-- read the theme version from ThemeInfo.ini to display on ScreenTitleMenu underlay
-- this allows players to more easily identify what version of the theme they are currently using

GetThemeVersion = function()
	local file = IniFile.ReadFile( THEME:GetCurrentThemeDirectory() .. "ThemeInfo.ini" )
	if file then
		if file.ThemeInfo and file.ThemeInfo.Version then
			return file.ThemeInfo.Version
		end
	end
	return false
end

-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
-- NOTE: This is the preferred way to check for RTT support, but we cannot rely on it to
--   accurately tell us whether the current system atually supports RTT!
--   Some players on Linux and [some version of] SM5.1-beta reported that DISPLAY:SupportsRenderToTexture()
--   returned false, when render to texture was definitely working for them.
--   I'm leaving this check here, but commented out, both as "inline instruction" for current SM5 themers
--   and so that it can be easily uncommented and used ~~when we are trees again~~ at a future date.

-- SupportsRenderToTexture = function()
-- 	-- ensure the method exists and, if so, ensure that it returns true
-- 	return DISPLAY.SupportsRenderToTexture and DISPLAY:SupportsRenderToTexture()
-- end


-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
-- SM5's d3d implementation does not support render to texture. The DISPLAY
-- singleton has a method to check this but it doesn't seem to be implemented
-- in RageDisplay_D3D which is, ironically, where it's most needed.  So, this.

SupportsRenderToTexture = function()
	-- This is not a sensible way to assess this; it is a hack and should be removed at a future date.
	if HOOKS:GetArchName():lower():match("windows")
	and PREFSMAN:GetPreference("VideoRenderers"):sub(1,3):lower() == "d3d" then
		return false
	end

	return true
